# ML-HitDiscovery-PLpro
Create a GitHub repository for the APP project aimed at identifying hits for the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein. Upload KNIME workflows, datasets used for model building, and a CSV file containing selected hit molecules. This repository will support future publication in the ACS Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling.
